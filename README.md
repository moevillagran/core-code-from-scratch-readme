1. Interpreted and compiled programming languages, explanation: 
1.1. Interpreted languages have a shared source code that can be run in most devices. The advantage of these programming languages is that they are easier to debug and make changes to them, without having to remake the whole code written for a certain app.
1.2. Compiled languages tend to be faster and allow the programmer to decide how the hardware will interact with the user. They are faster, but usually need an extra program to run in a variety of devices. For example, a program/app could be built in a compiled language but will need to be developed for Mac, Windows or Linux.
2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both? Java program is first compiled into bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then interpreted by the JVM making it as interpreted language. Note that Java implementations typically use a two-step compilation process. Java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use a technique called Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to compile the bytecode to native instructions understood by hardware CPU on the fly at runtime.

''' START
''' USD Amount <-- GET
''' BTCprice <-- GET FROM(https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)
''' Total <-- USD Amount / BTCprice
''' PRINT Total
